# Pin-a-photo-ASP.NET
Project conducted on the ASP. NET labs
The premise of the project is to create a small app that incorporates functionality from Pinterest and Instagram.
The components ultimately are to be:
- administrator profile (allowing you to remove unwanted content and users from the site)
- user profile (possibility to create, display data, update data, delete own content - CRUD)
- possibility to search for other users
- wall with photos (photo upload)
- space for comments and reactions to uploaded images
